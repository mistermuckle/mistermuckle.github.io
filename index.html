               <h1>About me</h1>
               
               <p class="p-summary summary">I have been a full-time Web developer since 2008, working primarily in <span class="p-skill skill">PHP</span>, <span class="p-skill skill">HTML5</span>, <span class="p-skill skill">CSS</span>/<span class="p-skill skill">LESS</span>, and <span class="p-skill skill">JavaScript</span> (including <span class="p-skill skill">jQuery</span>). Additionally, I have worked with <span class="p-skill skill">MySQL</span> and <span class="p-skill skill">Oracle</span> databases, and I am right at home on the <span class="p-skill skill">Unix command line</span>. I try to embrace the best qualities of each language to write maintainable, testable, <span class="p-skill skill">object-oriented code</span>.</p>
               
               <p class="p-experience experience h-event vevent">Since <time class="dt-start" datetime="2013-04"><abbr title="2013-04" class="dtstart">April, 2013</abbr></time>, I have been a <span class="p-name summary">senior Web developer</span> at <span class="h-card vcard"><a href="http://www.baesystems.com/en/cybersecurity" class="p-name fn org u-url url">BAE Systems Applied Intelligence</a> (formerly <span class="p-additional-name">SilverSky</span>)</span> in <span class="p-location location"><span class="h-adr"><span class="p-locality">Boston</span>, <abbr title="Massachusetts" class="p-region">MA</abbr></span></span>. <span class="p-description description">My work has focused on BAE-AI&rsquo;s web portal, used by customers to manage their various security services. I have led a push toward leaner, modular, and <span class="p-skill skill">unit-testable code</span>; the use of dependency-management tools like <span class="p-skill skill">Composer</span> and <span class="p-skill skill">Bower</span>; and developer communication and feedback through <span class="p-skill skill">code reviews</span>. Often I am called upon by other developers as a <span class="p-skill skill">mentor</span>, and as an authority on best practices, a role I thoroughly enjoy and am actively seeking to do more of.</span></p>
                   
           <p class="p-experience experience h-event vevent">From <time class="dt-start" datetime="2008-04"><abbr title="2008-04" class="dtstart">April, 2008</abbr></time> until <time class="dt-end" datetime="2013-03"><abbr title="2013-03" class="dtend">March, 2013</abbr></time>, I was a <span class="p-name summary">Web developer</span> at <span class="h-card vcard"><a href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com" class="p-name fn org u-url url">Blue State Digital</a></span>&rsquo;s <span class="p-location location"><span class="h-adr"><span class="p-locality">Boston</span>, <abbr title="Massachusetts" class="p-region">MA</abbr></span></span>, office. Known for supplying the technology that helped lead to the 2008 presidential election of Barack Obama, BSD provided an arena for enthusiastic Web developers to sharpen their skills. <span class="p-description description">I helped develop and maintain the company&rsquo;s Web toolset, working on features such as forms for honorary or <i>in memoriam</i> donations and <a href="http://tools.bluestatedigital.com/page/cards/send/take-a-test-drive">emailable greeting cards</a>. During the Obama campaign, I was one of two developers who helped support BSD&rsquo;s numerous other political and non-profit clients, often helping to build out sites using <span class="p-skill skill">Expression Engine</span>. Later during my tenure, I led development on a team that introduced chaptering to the company&rsquo;s offerings, allowing large organizations like the YMCA to manage their overall toolsets while giving their local chapters varying levels of autonomy in managing their own sites.</span></p>
