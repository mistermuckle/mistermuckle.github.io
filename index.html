               <p class="p-summary summary">I have been a full-time Web developer since 2008, working primarily in <span class="p-skill skill">PHP</span>, <span class="p-skill skill">HTML5</span>, <span class="p-skill skill">CSS</span>/<span class="p-skill skill">LESS</span>, and <span class="p-skill skill">JavaScript</span> (including <span class="p-skill skill">jQuery</span>). Additionally, I have worked with <span class="p-skill skill">MySQL</span> and <span class="p-skill skill">Oracle</span> databases, and I am right at home on the <span class="p-skill skill">Unix command line</span>. I try to embrace the best qualities of each language to write maintainable, <span class="p-skill skill">testable</span>, <span class="p-skill skill">object-oriented code</span>.</p>

I have led a push toward leaner, modular, and unit-testable code; the use of dependency-management tools like Composer and Bower; and developer communication and feedback through code reviews. Often I am called upon by other developers as a mentor, and as an authority on best practices, a role I thoroughly enjoy and am actively seeking to do more of.</span></p>

During the Obama campaign, I was one of two developers who helped support BSD&rsquo;s numerous other political and non-profit clients, often helping to build out sites using Expression Engine. Later during my tenure, I led development on a team that introduced chaptering to the company&rsquo;s offerings, allowing large organizations to manage their overall toolsets while giving their local chapters varying levels of autonomy in managing their own sites.</span></p>
