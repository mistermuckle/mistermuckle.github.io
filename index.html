               <h1>About me</h1>
               <p class="p-summary">I have been a full-time Web developer since 2008, working primarily in <span class="p-skill">PHP</span>, <span class="p-skill">HTML5</span>, <span class="p-skill">CSS</span>/<span class="p-skill">LESS</span>, and <span class="p-skill">JavaScript</span> (including <span class="p-skill">jQuery</span>). Additionally, I have worked with <span class="p-skill">MySQL</span> and <span class="p-skill">Oracle</span> databases, and I am right at home on the <span class="p-skill">Unix command line</span>. I try to embrace the best qualities of each language to write maintainable, <span class="p-skill">testable</span>, <span class="p-skill">object-oriented code</span>.</p>
               
               <p class="p-experience h-event">Since <time class="dt-start" datetime="2013-04">April, 2013</time>, I have been a <span class="p-name">senior web developer</span> at <span class="h-card"><a href="" class="p-name u-url">BAE Systems Applied Intelligence</a> (formerly <span class="p-additional-name">SilverSky</span>)</span> in <span class="p-location h-adr"><span class="p-locality">Boston</span>, <abbr title="Massachusetts ">MA</abbr></span>. <span class="p-description">My work has focused on BAE-AI´s web portal, used by customers to manage their various security services. I have led a push toward leaner, modular, and unit-testable code; the use of dependency-management tools like Composer and Bower; and developer communication and feedback through code reviews. Often I am called upon by other developers as a mentor, and as an authority on best practices, a role I thoroughly enjoy and am actively seeking to do more of.</span></p>
                   
           <p class="p-experience h-event">From <time class="dt-start" datetime="2008-04">April, 2008</time> until <time class="dt-end" datetime="2013-03">March, 2013</time>, I was a <span class="p-name">Web developer</span> at <span class="h-card"><a href="" class="p-name u-url">Blue State Digital</a></span>´s <span class="p-location h-adr"><span class="p-locality">Boston</span>, <abbr title="Massachusetts" class="p-region">MA</abbr></span>, office. Known for supplying the technology that helped lead to <span class="h-event">the <time class="dt-start" datetime="2008-11">November, 2008</time>, presidential election of Barack Obama</span>, BSD provided an arena for enthusiastic Web developers to sharpen their skills. <span class="p-description">I helped develop and maintain the company´s Web toolset, working on features such as forms for honorary or <i>in memoriam</i> donations and <a href="http://tools.bluestatedigital.com/page/cards/send/take-a-test-drive">emailable greeting cards</a>. During the Obama campaign, I was one of two developers who helped support BSD´s numerous other political and non-profit clients, often helping to build out sites using Expression Engine. Later during my tenure, I led development on a team that introduced chaptering to the company´s offerings, allowing large organizations to manage their overall toolsets while giving their local chapters varying levels of autonomy in managing their own sites.</span></p>
